# Craft-beer-in-MI-analysis
In this project I needed to answer a question "Where is the best place to find the biggest amount of different beers in Michigan state?"

At first, I was scraping good datasets from Kaggle, GitHub and other sources until found [this about beer](https://github.com/nickhould/craft-beers-dataset/blob/master/data/processed/beers.csv) and [this about breweries](https://github.com/nickhould/craft-beers-dataset/blob/master/data/processed/beers.csv).
It was the hardest part of this job as it`s not really popular topic for open datasets, some of links that were supposed to lead to good data (imho) were banned for copyright infringement, others have small amount of usable data. These two datasets were parsed from the website CraftCans by [Jean-Nicholas](https://github.com/nickhould), you can see the way he did it in his [blog](http://www.jeannicholashould.com/python-web-scraping-tutorial-for-craft-beers.html). Let's get back to my research.

The next part was way easier: tidying the data and excluding the segment I am interested in. (EDA)
As a result I got top-3 breweies in Michigan by amount of beer sorts they offer so now I'm ready to visit this state. At the end, I made a matplotlib visual which summarizes my research and then made a more beautiful version in Photoshop.

Here you can see it

Thanks for your attention)!
